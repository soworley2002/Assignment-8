# Assignment-8

## Project: StudyBuddy

StudyBuddy is a web application to help college students manage study schedules, collaborate in real time, and track progress toward learning goals. This repository contains the project proposal, planning artifacts, and instructions for producing the Jira and Confluence links required for the assignment submission.

**Project Proposal:** See `proposal.md` for the 150–200 word proposal describing the application, target users, core features, tech stack, and AI strategy.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React (CRA or Vite)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (Atlas or self-hosted)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Deployment:** Docker containers on Google Cloud Platform (GKE or Cloud Run)

**MVP (due Unit 12):**
- Shared study schedule creation and management
- Basic real-time chat for study groups
- Progress tracking dashboard with tasks and completion

**Acceptance Criteria (examples):**
- Users can create/edit/delete study sessions and invite peers.
- Chat supports sending and receiving messages in real time.
- Dashboard shows at least one visual progress metric.

**Jira & Confluence:** Create a Jira project with 2–3 epics and 3–5 user stories per epic (with subtasks). Create a Confluence space and add a "Project Overview" page that includes the proposal and tech decisions. Make both pages publicly viewable and paste the public URLs here when available.

**How to Submit:**
1. Upload the written proposal (`proposal.md` or a Word doc) to your Confluence space.
2. Create a public Jira project and a public Confluence space, then paste the URLs here.
3. Create or link a GitHub repository containing this README and any project code; paste the repo URL here.

If you want, I can prepare example Jira epics/user stories and Confluence content (copiable), and a ready-to-publish README template for your GitHub repo.
