StudyBuddy — Project Proposal

StudyBuddy is a web application designed to help college students plan study time, coordinate with peers, and track progress toward course goals. The app solves the common problem of fragmented tools and scattered schedules by unifying scheduling, real-time collaboration, and progress visualization into a single, student-focused platform. Users can create customizable study plans, form or join study groups, and monitor completion of tasks and goals.

Target users are college and university students who juggle multiple classes, deadlines, and group work. The app helps users reduce procrastination and increase accountability by enabling shared study sessions, reminders, and an intuitive progress dashboard. Secondary users include tutors and study-group leaders who need centralized coordination tools.

Core features: (1) Flexible study schedule creation and shared group sessions; (2) Real-time chat and resource sharing for groups; (3) Progress-tracking dashboard with task completion and goal visualization; (4) Notifications and reminders.

Technology stack: React frontend, Node.js + Express backend, MongoDB database, Docker for containers, Google Cloud for deployment, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

AI integration strategy: AI will assist with intelligent scheduling suggestions, automated study-plan generation from syllabus inputs, and in-chat summarization or clarification of shared resources.
